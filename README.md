# Projects with C++

Welcome to the "Projects with C++" repository! In this collection, I've implemented various projects using C++ and Data Structures to create algorithms for a queue and a stack. The projects included cover a range of applications, such as a container's stack, a hospital queue, an arithmetic expression solver, and a small theater simulation complete with a sales system, seat exchange, and refund functionality.

## Overview

In this repository, I leverage C++ and Data Structures to tackle different projects, emphasizing the implementation of algorithms related to queue and stack operations. The goal is to provide a practical demonstration of these concepts through real-world scenarios.

## Projects

Explore the variety of projects included in this repository:

1. **Container's Stack:** Implementing a stack data structure for managing a container.

2. **Hospital Queue:** Developing a queue system tailored for hospital operations.

3. **Arithmetic Expression Solver:** Creating an algorithm to solve arithmetic expressions.

4. **Theater Simulation:** A comprehensive project simulating a theater environment, featuring a sales system, seat exchange, and refund functionality.

Feel free to dive into the respective project folders to explore the source code, understand the implementations, and learn how these concepts are applied.
