# **Projects with C++**

### In this repository I used Data Structure to create algorithms to perform a _queue_ and a _stack_.
### For instance, I created a container's stack, hospital queue, an arithmetic expression and a small project that simulates a theater(with sales system, seat exchange and refund).
